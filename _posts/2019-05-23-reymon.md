5/23/19 Day 1 of Blogging Summer 2019
================

Hello World! My name is Reymon Pedroza! I am a rising sophomore at Claremont McKenna College and I am studying Computer Science via Harvey Mudd. 

For the summer, we will be working alongside Sustainable Claremont to create various projects and work towards accomplishing new goals. My team has been tasked with developing new programs as well as optimizing already-made applications developed by the previous teams. 

Today, we were given the task to see if we could optimize an existing function that displays the the weekly temperatures to be able to display the weather such as rain. Through this, we would be able to reduce the amount of messages telling residents to water their trees while it rains. As such, I have spent my day reading through the previous teamâ€™s research notes as well as learning Javascript to be able to edit their Google Scripts code. I have learned various techniques to get a similar desired results, but I have not actually been able to produce the specific climate output. I plan to hopefully be able to fix the current issues with the weatherInfo function tomorrow and be able to produce a climate output.

Tomorrow, we will be meeting with Sustainable Claremont for an update on our end of summer goals.
